/*
 * Integers and doubles have a minimum and maximum value
 * 
 * Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE 
 * 
 * For double it is 14-15 digits without errors
 * 
 * Trying to modify a variable outside its capacity (Range) will raise a number too large or number 
 * too small error
 * 
 * When an integer and a double interact in an operation java converts the result to a double
 * (by converting the int to a double first) THIS IS CALLED THE HIERARCHY OF TYPES 
 * (quizde nasil unuttum bilmiyorum juliada cok kullanilan bir olgu cunku multiple dispatch var)
 * 
 * 6.0 / 4 = 6 / 4.0 = (double) 6 / 4 = 1.5
 * 
 * Casting can also convert a floating point number to an integer by omitting the decimal values:
 * 
 * (int) 2.5 = 2
 * 
 * (int) n Â± 0.5 will round the number to the nearest integer instead of removing the decimals
 * 
 * The value of an expression is always based on the evaulation of the operations within it
