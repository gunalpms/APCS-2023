/*
 * When multiple variables refer to the same instance, a modification on one of the variables will 
 * effect the same object with other variables causing the object to change for all references
 * 
 * constructors with different types of variables or different amount of variables can be created 
 * using a concept called overloading. This allows us to create instances of the same class with default
 * values or with some values missing.
 * 
 * when an instance with no value is created, the reference type refers to null in the memory
