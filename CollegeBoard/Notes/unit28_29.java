/*
 * These wrapper classes are apparently useful with array lists(?) but alone I have not seen a purpose
 * 
 * Autoboxing and unboxing processes are done automatically by the compiler
 * 
 * The math class is static which means that they belong to a class, not an object
 * 
 * Therefore they do not need an instance variable to run
 * 
 * Math.random is not inclusive such that the function itself never returns 1. (returns limit)
