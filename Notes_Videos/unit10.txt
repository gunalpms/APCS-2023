/*
any iterative solution can be expressed recursively and vice versa

CallStackOveflowException thrown if base case is never reached. 

binary search works on a sorted list where a value is tried to be found by "squishing" a lower
and upper bound as indices

merge sort can recursively sort elements in a list.

merge sort separates a list to a left and right half until each sublist is of length 1, then orders
lists of 2^n-1 where n denotes the "level" of sorting by comparing sorted halfs and doing an 
optimized selection sort. since lists of length 1 are already "sorted", whenever a list is divided into
a length of 1, the merging begins.
