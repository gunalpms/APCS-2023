/*

A 2D array can be defined as an array of arrays.

It is a way to store multiple data concerning one data element of a single array.

For example, an array of 4 cats could hold 3 attributes for each cat, for instance their name, age and color

Arrays in which there are the same amount of elements for each "row" are called rectangular arrays.

Declaration:

datatype[][] name = new datatype[row_count][column_count];

Or:

name = {
    {elements}, {some_more_elements}, {there_really_is_no_limit}
}

In a rectangular array, to get the length of the columns, by convention, the first array is used

int len_column = array[0].length

Accessing the elements of a 2d array is nothing different than accessing the elements of a
1D array.
