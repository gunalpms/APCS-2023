/*

a subclass is a class that implements the attributes or methods of its parent class, aka superclass

all subclasses can have one superclass but a superclass can have multiple subclasses

a subclass will "inherit" every property of its superclass

when using the extends keyword, it is not possible to "skip" a class in the middle

for example if the classes are linked as a-b-c, c cannot extend a since there is b in the middle

constructors are not inherited unless specified with the keyword super

by default, the constructor of the subclass will call the no argument constructor of its superclass
before proceeding with its own construction of the object of the subclass.

super(arg, arg...); 

the above could be used to call the constructor of the superclass using arguments
it must be in the first line of the constructor since the call hierarchy goes up and it comes 
to the "home" subclass the latest.

a subclass cannot directly access the private data fields of its superclass
needs to use getter or setter functions to access/modify the private variables

in other words, inheritance only works with public properties, not private!

overriding is the process of rewriting a method inherited from a superclass within a subclass
it is only used when method signatures clash.

to call a method from the superclass, the following syntax can be used:

super.method(params)

polymorphism is a design pattern in which a reference variable can refer to an object in its own class
and an object form one of its superclasses. this is especially useful when the type of an object
that would be added to a collection can't be known beforehand. example:

suppose that x, y and z are subclasses of class a

a[] ourList = new a[3];
a[0] = x;

this is perfectly valid since a is being extened by the type/class x and therefore a variable
refering to the type x can be of type a. this would also be true for the types y and z in this example.
