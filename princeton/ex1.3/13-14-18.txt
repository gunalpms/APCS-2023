The questions 13-14-18 await an explanation on already existing code

Q13) 987654321 = m and 0 = n after the code executes. It puts the reverse of the first int 
to the second int because it multiplies each digit by 10 such that it stays on the "inverse nth digit"

Q14) It prints out fib numbers until the 15th fib number (incl.) It employs a recursive tactic
without actually recursively calling a funciton. F becomes the n-1st number and g becomes the n-2nd number

Q18) answer d is correct because it casts the denominator value to a double which in return
converts the division to a double and the sum to a double. If it stayed int it could have caused overflow.
