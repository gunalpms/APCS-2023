/* NOTLAR

Classes help structure code such that it is easier to categorize certain functions and 
variables to help the programmer. Each instance of a class is called an object, classes have an
initiation function that runs whenever the instance is created. Functions within a class are called
a method and (instance) variables, attributes.

A class can run multiple instances at the same time, usually with different parameters to accelerate
computing. To create instances with different parameters, such arguments should be defined within 
the class. To access attributes and methods of a class, the dot operator can be used followed by the
desired attribute or method name on an instance of the object.
