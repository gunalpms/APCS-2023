/*
 * Object methods are called on an object with the dot operator followed by the method name 
 * and a set of paranthesis with or without parameters in it. E.g:
 * 
 * Object.method(parameter1, parameter2);
 * 
 * Procedural abstraction is the practise of utilizing methods without looking up their code.
 * If you know what it does, you don't need to now how it does it.
