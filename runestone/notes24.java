/*
 * The paranthesis when a method is called is used for passing arguments. Arguments are data that can 
 * tell the program how to perform a specific task that is described in a method. Such as:
 * 
 * .forward(n) where n is an integer that represents the amount of pixels a turtle goes forward
 * 
 * When you program a method to take specific arguments and give them a default value/type, that is 
 * called a formal parameter
 * 
 * Method overloading is when a method can be called with different amounts of parameters
 * 
 * .forward(100) vs .forward()
