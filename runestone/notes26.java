/*
 * When you try to print a variable with the value null it prints null. (Strings can be assigned null)
 * 
 * Assigning null to a string shows that it does not refer to any object yet
 * 
 * String strname new String("content") is also a valid way to create a string
 * 
 * String strname = "content" -> this usage is called string literals  
 * 
 * Class of a string object is String, the class of a String is Object. Interesting
 * 
 * Every instance of a string inherits some methods and fields from the String class.
 * 
 * Every instance in java will at some point reach the Object class (highest class in Java class order)
