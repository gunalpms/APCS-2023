/*
 * wrapper classes are surrounding classes for primitive data types that provide methods
 * that you can use for the respective data types
 * 
 * In java 9+ you can just say Integer / Double i = val but in the exam 
 * the following syntax is needed:
 * 
 * Integer / Double i = new Integer / Double (i)
 * 
 * autoboxing happens when a method is called upon a primitve type instance that expects
 * an object. For example, int is converted to Integer. The reverse process is called 
 * unboxing
 * 
 * A common usage example for a wrapper class is the parseInt / parseDouble methods that are
 * in their respective wrapper clases (Integer and Double)
 *
